      <description>This book had been on my TO-READ list for a long time. It came up again while I was perusing Dan Luu&amp;rsquo;s Programming book list. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to look behind the curtains and see how the magic worked, so I finally bought it.
I used bootlin to read through Linux 5.7.2 source. They provide a really good search system and linked definitions. The book describes kernel version 2.6. You might want to keep this site open to see how things have changed since then.</description>
