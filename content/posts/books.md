I am one of those people who need to write things down to fully understand and assimilate a foreign piece of information. Writing forces me to put into words that abstract mass of obscure blob of thought which I manifest into existence whenever I encounter a new topic. It helps me structure my understanding, and often times makes me aware of gaping holes in my understanding of the topic. Naturally, I take copious amounts of notes whenever I read a technical book / paper.

I've been searching for a platform independent way to make my markdown notes accessible across all my devices so that I could dip in and check it at will. I've iterated through multiple wiki based schemes, hand-rolled scripts to sync my notes to cloud drives, and tried multiple platforms / services that promised to do the same. But they never quite fit into my workflow.

The new /books section is my experiment to migrate all those notes to github pages. It forces me to format them in a way that's palatable to a wider audience and also enables me to access it anywhere I wish. A spiffy combination of [notational-fzf-vim](https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim) and [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) helps me keep my notes in sync (workflow post coming soon!).

Check it out [here](/books).

As always, ping me your thoughts and comments. Let me know if you have a better suggestion to keep my notes and snippets in check!

P.S: I was heavily inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/book)
